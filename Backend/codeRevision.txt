For database query code revision, we added a Listing class so that the listing information can be stored as instance variables in this class. Originally, the listing information was stored in a tuple, and it was not clear what each entry stands for. This modification is a refactorization that increases usability and readability of the code.  
Modify comments to indicate more clearly what kind of information each function returns. 
Modify some function names such as getHostSingleListingPct to make it more descriptive.
