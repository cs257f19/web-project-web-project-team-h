# About this repository
This is the repository for the term-long database-driven web project in CS 257, Fall 2019.

Contents:
- Personas: directory, contains all personas developed for this project
- UserStories: directory, contains all your team's user stories
- Data: directory, contains the raw and processed data along with any metadata
- Webpages: directory, contains all html and css code of webpages already designed. They should all be opened by Chrome to enable keyboard interaction.
  - Homepage: homepage of the entire project about Airbnb in New York City 
  - About data: Data page that includes metadata and description of entire dataset.
  - Sample output page: It is a sample page for host searching giving the host some general idea about the ranking and relative popularity and price of his/her house compared to similar listings. This page can be accessed by clicking on "For Host" on the navigation bar or clicking on the "Host" button on the homepage. For now, the search and the result are in the same page, but we will probabably seperate them in the future.
